# Bright Cloud Studio's Isotope Spec Sheet PDF
## Generates a PDF Spec Sheet when clicking a link on an Isotope Product Reader page within Contao.

This package adds a link to Isotope's Product Reader which when clicked will generate a PDF "spec sheet" file containing information found on the page. Typically, our clients are always creating PDF spec sheets that need to be updated. This will instead create the spec sheets on the fly, always containing the latest information.
